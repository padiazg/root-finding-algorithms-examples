# Root-Finding Algorithms Series

Root-finding algorithms are an essential part of numerical analysis and have applications in various scientific and engineering fields. This series aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of these algorithms, starting with the basics and gradually moving to more advanced techniques.

This repository is dedicated to examples and implementations for the theory explained across this series.

The articles are published on [Pato Diaz](https://padiazg.github.io/) and [DEV Community](https://dev.to/padiazg).

## Introduction


## Index of Parts

- [Introduction to Root-Finding Algorithms, Part 2](part-2/README.md)

## Part 2: Introduction to Root-Finding Algorithms

The second article in this series introduces the dives deeper into the concept of root-finding algorithms. It covers several methods, including:
- Bisection Method
- Newton-Raphson Method
- Secant Method

The code examples for these methods can be found in the [part-2](part-2) directory.

## Future Parts

Future articles will continue to explore more advanced root-finding algorithms and their applications.
